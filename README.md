#  SQL-XSS-LFI Vulnerability Scanner

##  Description
The **SQL-XSS-LFI Vulnerability Scanner** is an automated security tool designed to identify potential vulnerabilities in web applications. It leverages advanced **Google Dorking** techniques to discover URLs that may be susceptible to:

-  **SQL Injection (SQLi)**
-  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
-  **Local File Inclusion (LFI)**

This tool utilizes **Google, Bing, and Yandex** search engines to find potential targets and systematically test them for security flaws.

##  Features
 **Automated Dork Scanning** – Searches for vulnerable URLs using search engines.  
 **SQL Injection Detection** – Identifies possible SQLi vulnerabilities.  
 **XSS Testing** – Checks for cross-site scripting flaws.  
 **LFI Exploitation Detection** – Scans for local file inclusion vulnerabilities.  
 **TOR Integration** – Uses the TOR network to anonymize requests.  
 **Multi-Threaded Execution** – Speeds up scanning by testing multiple URLs simultaneously.

##  Installation

###  Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your system. Additionally, you need the **TOR service** running before executing the script.

###  Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install requests pysocks google
```

###  Start the TOR Service
Before running the script, ensure the TOR service is active:

```bash
sudo service tor start  # Linux
```

 **Windows Users:** Open the **TOR browser** and keep it running.

##  Usage

To run the scanner, execute:

```bash
python dork_scanner.py
```

You'll be prompted to enter a **Google Dork query**. The script will then retrieve URLs and test them for vulnerabilities.

###  Example:
```
Enter Google Dork: inurl:index.php?id=
Found 35 relevant URLs. Testing for vulnerabilities...
[VULNERABLE] http://example.com/index.php?id=1
    - SQL Injection (Payload: ' OR 1=1 --)
[SAFE] http://secure-site.com/index.php?id=5
```
